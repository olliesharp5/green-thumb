            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Established in the late nineties by Oliver Sharp, a then-teenager with a fascination for the outdoors and botany, Green Thumb has stood out in the world of online plant retail right from its inception. Oliver realised that the quality of plants from conventional mail order firms often fell short, their growth stunted and disappointing. Convinced of their ability to offer superior plants, Green Thumb sprouted from this innovative vision.</p>

            <p>While enrolled at the globally acclaimed Writtle College horticulture program, Oliver meticulously nurtured and grew the business. Financed through the earnings from his part-time jobs, Oliver's diligent effort resulted in a flourishing operation. The year 2005, following Oliver's graduation, proved to be a significant milestone with the website's makeover, acquisition of extensive quarters, and a burgeoning nursery construction. With an ever-growing team brought on board to cope with increasing demand, the business evolved into a significant force in mail-order gardening. The unwavering commitment to quality, impeccable service, and cost-effectiveness helped it become one of the UK's leading independent online Garden Centres.</p>

            <h2>Our Reputation</h2>
            <p>Our blossoming reputation quickly spread through our customer base and their associates, and we now dispatch thousands of plants each week within the UK and across Europe. Green Thumb has formed collaborations with prominent brands and organisations, constantly innovating to remain distinct from the wave of competitors entering the online gardening niche. We find it flattering knowing that our brand serves as the standard that others strive to meet.</p>

            <p>In recognition of our exceptional quality, we've had the privilege of being chosen as a plant supplier for distinguished designers who take part in prestigious events such as the RHS Chelsea Flower Show. Celebrities, PR firms, and movie set designers also trust us to provide their plants.</p>

            <p>Despite our continuing growth, plants remain the core of our business. With Chris still actively involved, the values that Green Thumb was built on are still at the heart of all we do. We strive to maintain our commitment to quality and service. Stay updated with us, as our plant inventory persistently changes to reflect the rhythm of the seasons!</p>
